## üöÄ Getting Started With Development

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v21+ recommended)
-   **node-gyp** (required for `iracing-sdk`)
    -   Install globally if not present: `npm install -g node-gyp`
    -   [node-gyp installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Start the Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

### Start the Fuel sharing server (optional)

To use the fuel sharing server you need to either host it online or run locally and then port forward the port that the server runs on (by default 8081). Make sure you have a public IP-address if you decide to self host the fuel sharing server.

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm start
```
